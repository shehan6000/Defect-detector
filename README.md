# Defect Detection System

This project implements a defect detection system for products during the manufacturing process using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is designed to identify defective products based on synthetic image data.



## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify images of products as defective or non-defective. The project includes the following steps:

1. Generating synthetic image data for training and testing.
2. Building a CNN model for image classification.
3. Training the model on the synthetic data.
4. Evaluating the model's performance.
